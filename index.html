            <h1>What is Repeal Jam?</h1>
            <p>
                The 8th amendment is a topic that effects everyone in Ireland, but the experience of its impact is very 
                personal and often private. Games have a unique ability to put the player in another persons shoes, 
                present them with the same choices and let them experience the realities of different situations. 
            </p>

        <p>
            Political games are a campaign device that is slowly growing. These games reach different demographics 
            than those usually targeted in campaigns and often have an ability to appeal to people of different political 
            affiliations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Repeal Jam</strong> is a creative event in support of the campaign to repeal the 8th amendment. We're looking at 
            using games to reach different people who may not be as informed on the referendum or who don't think they're 
            affected by it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although primarily a game jam, all mediums are welcome to join and get creative for repeal.

            <h1>Repeal Jam Code of Conduct</h1>
  
        <p>
            <strong>Repeal Jam</strong> is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone , regardless of gender, 
            gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or 
            religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Event participants violating these 
            rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organisers. Our anti-harassment 
            policy can be found at: <a href="https://repealjam.github.io">repealjam.github.io</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual 
                    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
                </li>
                <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
                <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
                <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
                <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
                <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
                <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
            </ul>          
        </p>
        <h2>Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately</p>
        <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a 
            welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the 
            event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
        </p>        
        <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think 
            people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
        </p>        
        
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
        <p>
            If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.  
            Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be 
            happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
            When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve 
            other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what 
            happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to 
            support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.
        </p>        
        <p>
            Our team will be happy to help you contact local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or 
            otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
